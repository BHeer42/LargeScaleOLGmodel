# LargeScaleOLGmodel
Computation of a large-scale overlapping generations model from Chapter 10 of Heer/Maussner (2009)

'Dynamic General Equilibrium Modeling: Computational Methods and Applications'
(2nd edition, 2009)

By Burkhard Heer and and Alfred Mau√üner --- Python Code for Chapter 10

In this repository, you find the solution to a multi-dimensional value function
iteration problem with individual uncertainty. The material is completely new
and intended for a new third edition of the book. Its purpose is to solve
a multi-dimensional heterogeneous agent overlapping-generations model
and the endogenous distribution of assets and cumulated contributions
to the pension system.

The model is described in the attached pdf file 
'manuscript_Ch9_bidimensional_optimization.pdf'.
