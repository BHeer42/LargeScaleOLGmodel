'Dynamic General Equilibrium Modeling: Computational Methods and Applications'
(2nd edition, 2009)

By Burkhard Heer and and Alfred Mau√üner --- Python Code for Chapter 10


In this rar-file, you find the solution to a multi-dimensional value function
iteration problem with individual uncertainty. The material is completely new
and intended for a new third edition of the book. Its purpose is to solve
a multi-dimensional heterogeneous agent overlapping-generations model
and the endogenous distribution of assets and cumulated contributions
to the pension system.

The model is described in the attached pdf file 
'manuscript_Ch9_bidimensional_optimization.pdf'.

You need to store the PYTHON code 'OLG_simgle_VI_19dec2020.py'
and the input file with the age-dependent
survival probabilities and age-efficiency profile
'survival_probs.xlsx' in the same directory.



The files in Python_Chapter10_heer_maussner_dsge.rar are:
========================================================

readme_ch10_python.txt: this file

OLG_simple_VI_19dec2020.py: main PYTHON program file

survival_probs.xlsx: Excel input file for the PYTHON program

manuscript_Ch9_bidimensional_optimization.pdf: model description


Instructions:
=============

In order to run the Python programs, you simply need to store the file and the Excel file in the same directory and run it. You also 
need to install libraries numpy and scipy.

Run time: approximately 8 hours.

A good introduction into Python and a description of the installation of Python can be found on
the website of Thomas Sargent and John Starchuski
